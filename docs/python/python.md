# **Python**
--- 

## RANDOM
* modulo : %
* checktype : type(var)
* lower_copy = "text".lower()
* dir("stuff") : Returns list available methods
* "banana".find("na") : Position premiere apparition #2
* "banana".replace("na","OK") : # "baOKOK"
* "banana".strip() : remove leading and trailling characters
So, to recap letâ€™s try and break the difference between is and == down to two short definitions:

* An is expression evaluates to True if two variables point to the same (identical) object.
* An == expression evaluates to True if the objects referred to by the variables are equal (have the same contents).
* dict.get(key,0) : Get key value, put 0 as feault if does not exists
* dict.keys()  : Returns random order list of keys
* dict.values() : Returns random order(but same as keys() !) list of values
* dict.items() : Returns list of (Keys,Values) tuples
* for a,b in list.items(): print (a,b) : Iterate on both ! 
* a = sorted(list,reverse=True) : Descending sorted list 
* ord('n') : Gives the ordinal number used for sorting string (ASCII characters)
tuple are more efficient than list, use it for temporary variables
### Regular expression

Python Regular Expression Quick Guide
import re 
```txt
^        Matches the beginning of a line
$        Matches the end of the line
.        Matches any character
\s       Matches whitespace
\S       Matches any non-whitespace character
*        Repeats a character zero or more times
*?       Repeats a character zero or more times 
         (non-greedy)
+        Repeats a character one or more times
+?       Repeats a character one or more times 
         (non-greedy)
[aeiou]  Matches a single character in the listed set
[^XYZ]   Matches a single character not in the listed set
[a-z0-9] The set of characters can include a range
(        Indicates where string extraction is to start
)        Indicates where string extraction is to end
```
re.findall() : return list of string matching expression

greedy matching takes the longer
add a ? to remove the greedy behaviour

Python library for TCP sockets : sockets
Python library for simplified requests: urllib

### Web scraping
Beautiful Soup
Know if it is allowed with /reobots.txt file on websites (Ex : wikipedia.org/robots.txt)

### Wire protocol
XML or JSON : Format not specific to language to send info from one to another

#### XML
```xml
Start tag : <person> (can have any name)
Closing tag : </person> (can have any name)
Text content : <name>Thibaut</name>
Attribute : type="int" (key='value' pair)
Self closing tag : <name hide='true'/>
```

with python
xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
data = """
<name>Chuck</name>
<email hide="yes"/>
"""
tree.find('name').text : Return text inside name Tag
tree.find('email').get('hide') : return hide attribute value from email Tag

#### XML schema (XSD by W3C)
used to validate a XML file is correct.

#### JSON
import json

Same as dict for python

### Web services
API : Application Program Interface
Oauth : Key to identifie a specific user (Usefyull for rate limiting etc)

### Object programming
Inheritance

### Relational Database
* Use integers for keys !
* Do not replicate data !
* Add id colum to every table !

#### Foreign Keys
* Primary Key : Generally an integer auto-increment field
* Logical Key : What the outside world uses for lookup
* Foreign key : Generally an integer key pointing to a row in another table

Best practices : 
* Never uses your logical key as the primary key
* relationships absed on integers are more efficient

#### Many-to-many
Connection table with 2 foreign keys
Use PRIMARY KEY (user_id,course_id) to make sure it's unique and optimize DB.

#### Indexes
Used to improve access performance for things like string fields
