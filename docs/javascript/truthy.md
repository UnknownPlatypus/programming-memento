# Truthy / Falsy

In JavaScript, a truthy or falsy value is a value that is being casted into a boolean when evaluated in a boolean context. An example of boolean context would be the evaluation of an ```if``` condition:

Every value will be casted to ```true``` unless they are equal to:

- ```false```
- ```0```
- ```""``` (empty string)
- ```null```
- ```undefined```
- ```NaN```

Here are examples of *boolean context*:

- ```if``` condition evaluation

```js
if (myVar) {}
```

```myVar``` can be any [first-class citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen) (variable, function, boolean) but it will be casted into a boolean because it's evaluated in a boolean context.

- After logical **NOT** ```!``` operator

This operator returns false if its single operand can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.

```js
!0 // true -- 0 is falsy so it returns true
!!0 // false -- 0 is falsy so !0 returns true so !(!0) returns false
!!"" // false -- empty string is falsy so NOT (NOT false) equals false
```

- With the *Boolean* object constructor

```js
new Boolean(0) // false
new Boolean(1) // true
```

- In a ternary evaluation

```js
myVar ? "truthy" : "falsy"
```

myVar is evaluated in a boolean context.

Be careful when comparing 2 values. The object values (that should be cast to true) is **not** being casted to Boolean but it forced to convert into a primitive value one using [ToPrimitives specification](http://javascript.info/object-toprimitive). Internally, when an object is compared to Boolean value like `[] == true`, it does `[].toString() == true` so...

```js
let a = [] == true // a is false since [].toString() give "" back.
let b = [1] == true // b is true since [1].toString() give "1" back.
let c = [2] == true // c is false since [2].toString() give "2" back.
```
