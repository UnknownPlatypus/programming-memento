# Class

JavaScript is a [prototype-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) language (whereas Java is [class-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming) language, for instance). ES6 has introduced JavaScript classes which are meant to be a syntactic sugar for prototype-based inheritance and **not** a new class-based inheritance model ([ref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)).

The word *class* is indeed error prone if you are familiar with classes in other languages. If you do, avoid assuming how JavaScript classes work on this basis and consider it an entirely different notion.

Since this document is not an attempt to teach you the language from the ground up, I will assume you know what prototypes are and how they behave. If you do not, see the external resources listed below the sample code.

## Samples

Before ES6, prototype syntax:

```js
var Person = function(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
Person.prototype.stringSentence = function() {
  return "Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I'm " + this.age;
}
```

With ES6 class syntax:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  stringSentence() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age}`;
  }
}

const myPerson = new Person("Manu", 23);
console.log(myPerson.age) // 23
console.log(myPerson.stringSentence()) // "Hello, my name is Manu and I'm 23
```
