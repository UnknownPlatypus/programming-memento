# `Extends` and `super` keywords

The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class which is a child of another class ([Ref: MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/extends)). The subclass inherits all the properties of the superclass and additionally can add new properties or modify the inherited ones.

The `super` keyword is used to call functions on an object's parent, including its constructor.

- `super` keyword must be used before the `this` keyword is used in constructor
- Invoking `super()` calls the parent class constructor. If you want to pass some arguments in a class's constructor to its parent's constructor, you call it with `super(arguments)`.
- If the parent class have a method (even static) called `X`, you can use `super.X()` to call it in a child class.

## Sample Code

```js
class Polygon {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.name = 'Polygon';
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }

  getHelloPhrase() {
    return `Hi, I am a ${this.name}`;
  }
}

class Square extends Polygon {
  constructor(length) {
    // Here, it calls the parent class' constructor with lengths
    // provided for the Polygon's width and height
    super(length, length);
    // Note: In derived classes, super() must be called before you
    // can use 'this'. Leaving this out will cause a reference error.
    this.name = 'Square';
    this.length = length;
  }

  getCustomHelloPhrase() {
    const polygonPhrase = super.getHelloPhrase(); // accessing parent method with super.X() syntax
    return `${polygonPhrase} with a length of ${this.length}`;
  }

  get area() {
    return this.height * this.width;
  }
}

const mySquare = new Square(10);
console.log(mySquare.area) // 100
console.log(mySquare.getHelloPhrase()) // 'Hi, I am a Square' -- Square inherits from Polygon and has access to its methods
console.log(mySquare.getCustomHelloPhrase()) // 'Hi, I am a Square with a length of 10'
```

**Note :** If we had tried to use `this` before calling `super()` in Square class, a ReferenceError would have been raised:

```js
class Square extends Polygon {
  constructor(length) {
    this.height; // ReferenceError, super needs to be called first!

    // Here, it calls the parent class' constructor with lengths
    // provided for the Polygon's width and height
    super(length, length);

    // Note: In derived classes, super() must be called before you
    // can use 'this'. Leaving this out will cause a reference error.
    this.name = 'Square';
  }
}
```
